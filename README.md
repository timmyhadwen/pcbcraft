# PCBCraft

One native window for schematic, board layout, libraries and checks. Every edit
goes through a typed engine command. The desktop, the CLI and MCP call the same
commands.

GPL-3.0-or-later. UI toolkit: pinned `craft-ui` from `storytold/craft-libs`.

This is a working foundation: a schematic, assigned footprints, basic routing,
checks, and fabrication output. It is not a finished production suite. Open
items live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

**Start here:** [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)

## Run

Rust 1.95 or newer. On Ubuntu, install window libraries first:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev \
  libx11-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wdunn001/pcbcraft.git
cd pcbcraft
cargo run -p pcbcraft -- --sample
```

Same `cargo run` line on native Windows. Headless MCP:

```sh
cargo run -p pcbcraft-cli -- mcp
```

Fork of record: [wdunn001/pcbcraft](https://github.com/wdunn001/pcbcraft). Tagged
builds, when published, appear under
[Releases](https://github.com/wdunn001/pcbcraft/releases).

## First circuit

Load **LED example**. **A** places a symbol; click to drop it. **W**, then two
pin circles, draws a wire. If neither pin has a net, one is created; two
different existing nets are refused. **Sync to PCB** creates footprints for
assigned parts. **X**, then two same-net pads, routes an orthogonal track.
**Checks** lists what is still wrong.

Save a `.pcbcraft` project. The route tool does not dodge obstacles. Moving a
footprint does not drag its tracks. Crossing wires do not join nets.
