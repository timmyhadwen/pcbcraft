# Roadmap and current status

The target is a complete Rust EDA application with MCP access to every feature.
This checklist records implementation, not an estimated parity percentage.
Each open line names the tracker issue that carries it. The program status epic,
tangency-labs/pcbcraft#352, mirrors this list with what is in flight and the open
owner decisions. Milestone names here match the `milestone:` tags described in
CONTRIBUTING.md: M1 to M4 are `milestone:m1` to `milestone:m4`, M5 is
`milestone:m5`, M6 is `milestone:m6`.

## Workbench and UX

User-interface work that cuts across milestones. These lines carry
`track:ui-design` and no `milestone:` tag.

- [x] Top menu bar, Start page, plain menu labels, canvas handles, pin and pad click wiring, stackup-first Layers, status strip, Review groups, custom checks, unified library sources and sets, drawn machine layer model
- [ ] Workbench layout: top menu bar, library left, assistant and Layers tree right, tool strip under the tabs (#299)
- [ ] One vector-style Layers tree replaces the Parts, Nets and Layers docks (#274)
- [ ] Draw directly on your own layers from the canvas (#275)
- [ ] Rules and Checks as top tabs, Project Settings with breathing room (#278)
- [ ] Right-click context menu on the canvas (#279)
- [ ] Library browser with filters in the left dock (#280)

- [ ] Several designs open at once, one document tab each (#347)
- [ ] Assistant pane backed by the typed command surface (#348)
- [ ] Assistant epic: bring the assistant structure of a sibling Craft app into PCBCraft (#360), with its core crate (#366), backends (#367, #374), settings (#368), edit gate (#369), context (#370), knowledge retrieval (#371), transcript (#372), offline behaviour and story suite (#373) and shared home decision (#375)
- [ ] Move the end-to-end stories out of the UI crate's lib.rs into `crates/ui-egui/tests/e2e/<area>.rs` (#392)
- [ ] Help reference: electrical engineering terms, formulas and calculators inside the app (issue to be filed; related to #350)

No feature is considered complete solely because a command exists. Workflows need
usable UI, working MCP access, reference fixtures and meaningful verification.
