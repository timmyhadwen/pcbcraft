//! Built-in table of common laminates for the physical layer record.

//! Values are typical figures from each maker's published data, kept as

//! # Rules
//! - Every entry carries the frequency its figures were stated at and a source note.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//! - Used by `LayerRecord::dk` and `LayerRecord::df` in `lib.rs`.
//!
//! # Do not
//! - Add an entry without a source note.
