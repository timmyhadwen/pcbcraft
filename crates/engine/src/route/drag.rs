/// Drag one end of track `id` to `position`, keeping the other end fixed.
///
/// The segment is taken out and its net, width and layer are routed from the
/// fixed end to the new spot as 45-degree copper. In `OctilinearShove` mode
/// other nets' tracks may be pushed aside. The caller (`Session::batch`) keeps
/// the old project when this returns an error, so a refusal changes nothing.
///
/// # Rules
/// - `Orthogonal` is not a drag mode: it has no obstacle checks.
/// - The two ends may not meet and the new end must lie on the board.
///
/// # Dependencies
/// - `route/mod.rs` `run` for the path search and the shove.
///
/// # Do not
/// - Do not move the fixed end or other segments of the same net.
/// - Do not bypass `route::run`'s DRC comparison.
