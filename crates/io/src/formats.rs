//! The format registry: one table naming every file format PCBCraft reads or writes.
//!
//! Context: owner decision 2026-10-29 (issue #194). The File menu has no per-format
//! items; Open, Import, Save as and Export as build their format lists, desktop file
//! filters and the browser `accept` list from [`FORMATS`], so a new format is added
//! here and nowhere else. A row only *describes* a format and names the command that
//! runs it; the readers and writers stay where they are.
//! Local rules:
//! - Every format has exactly one [`Scope`]. Save as lists the `Project` scope that
//!   can be written; Export as lists the `Output` scope; the two never overlap.
//! - The first row matching an extension wins in [`for_path`].
//! - A [`Run`] names a real command or tool and every option with a `param` names a
//!   documented parameter of it; the tests in `crates/mcp/src/lib.rs` pin both.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//! - crates/doc/src/lib.rs (`OUTPUT_KINDS`, checked by the mcp tests)
//! - crates/engine/src/lib.rs (`bom_export`, `commands`)
//!
//! # Do not
//! - Add a File menu item for one format; add a row here instead.
//! - Put a path, host name or user name in a row.
