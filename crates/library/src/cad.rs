//! Shared vocabulary for online CAD sources: what a part reference looks like,
//! which licence and credit travel with a file, and the trait every source
//! implements. A CAD source supplies symbol, footprint and 3D model files, not
//! stock or prices (those stay on `PartSource` in `crates/library/src/sources.rs`).
//!
//! # Rules
//! - No network, disk or clock access here; implementations bring their own.
//! - Every text field is bounded and free of control characters before a source sees it.
//! - Nothing here changes `PartResult`; other branches build it with struct literals.
//!
//! # Dependencies
//! - crates/library/src/sources.rs
