//! Controls that keep to the 24 by 24 pixel pointer-target minimum (WCAG 2.2, 2.5.8).
//!
//! Context: egui's `small_button` and a bare `TextEdit` ignore `interact_size`
//! and come out 15 to 19 pixels tall. The app uses these two wrappers instead,
//! so every such control is at least `App::MIN_TARGET` on both sides.
//! Local rules: keep the look; only the hit size grows. The check that proves it
//! is `e2e/shell.rs` `a_newcomer_never_meets_a_control_too_small_to_hit`.
